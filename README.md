# Typing Speed Calculator

This Python program measures typing speed, accuracy, and the number of mistakes made by a user as they type a randomly selected paragraph. The program also calculates the words per minute (WPM).

## Features

- **Random Paragraph Selection**: Randomly selects a paragraph from a predefined list.
- **Timer Functionality**: Measures the time taken to type the paragraph.
- **Word Count**: Calculates the number of words typed.
- **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Computes words per minute based on typing speed.
- **Mistake Count**: Counts the number of correct words, mistakes, and identifies incorrectly typed words.
- **Typing Accuracy**: Calculates typing accuracy as a percentage.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aalifida/typing-speed-calculator.git
   cd typing-speed-calculator
   ```

2. **Ensure you have Python installed on your system**:
   - Python can be downloaded and installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python typing_speed_calculator.py
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- flet library

## Installation

1. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install flet
   ```

## Running the Application
